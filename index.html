        1. I have done some coding in Core 1: Interaction class last semester. I really enjoyed working on CSS animation last semester because it is simple but dynamic. On the other hand, I found Javascript very confusing, especially because strike started just after starting to learn JS. 
      </br>
      <br>
        2. I am pretty excited about this class that I will get to learn how to visualize what I have always only thought of. I am also a little worried about the challenges I will face while learning how to code. 
      </br>
      <br>
        3. As I have no specific idea of what I am going to do professionally after graduation yet, I also do not see how code can fit in my life, but I think it is definitely something I would pursue. 
      </br>
      <br>
        4. HTML is the basic structure of the website, CSS controls presentation, formatting, and layout, and lastly, JS controls the relationships between elements. I would say if a human body is HTML, CSS is outfit, and JS is thoughts.

        5. GitHub is a platform to host versions of webpages and collaborate.

    13. Gradient
    <div class="my-box" style="height: 500px; width: 500px; border: 1px solid"></div>
    14. CSS gradient works based on percentage that a color will posess in a area, this case, a box. Also the backgorund color works as a base, and two other colors I selected goes on top, according to the angle and the percentage.
